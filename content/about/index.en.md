👋 **Youngshin Son**

I’m a machine learning engineer with a background in the game and music streaming industry. I like building things that entertain people -- and I always try to enjoy myself in the process, too. Besides work, I usually end up reading books or watching movies, and I occasionally play games and do a bit of yoga. I just can't deal with any kind of going out, facing uncertainty, or coming home without a dog wagging its tail.

The name I use online comes from a character in a novel with the following annotation:
> It’s a play on William Blake’s poem that begins, ‘I asked a thief to steal me a peach,’ referring to the name Peachthief. — *James Tiptree Jr., “Slow Music” (1980)*

I write short notes [here](https://pizzathief.pages.dev/).
